					<p>We have developed a dyeing process that is efficient and eco-friendly. We use the most advanced computerized color matching and dyeing apparatus and high performance dye-jets. The dye-jets are custom programmed to use exact amount of pigmentation so that residual water after the dyeing is clear and run off can be released without adding harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde based dyes that can destroy our groundwater.</p>
					<p>Our dye-lab is located in the USA, in a geographical area with the toughest environmental and pollution standards. We are very proud to have developed processes that meet and exceed these strict environmental regulations.</p>

					<p>Significant work has been done to solve for and create a supply chain as close to YOGASMOGA HQ (New York City) as possible.</p>
					<p>We do not produce in China and do not ship goods 12,500 miles across the globe –– this reduces our fossil fuel usage dramatically. While we can make cheap goods in China, we have made the conscious decision not to do so. We manufacture as close to home as possible with goods travelling 1/4th the distance as compared to our competitors, dramatically reducing our carbon footprint.</p>
					<p>We source trims such as elastics and threads as close to our production facilities as possible, thus reducing fossil fuel usage.</p>

					<p>Our production facilities have been awarded the Platinum Certificate of Compliance from WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production). Our facilities are also participating suppliers of the Fair Labor Association. (Just in case you were wondering –– Yes its kind of a big deal to achieve these certifications!)</p>
					<p>They also have extensive green environment programs including recycling, energy saving production measures, use of clean fuels like LPG's, reforestation and use of biodegradable chemicals.</p>

We research & develop it, we manufacture it, we dye it, we cut it, we stitch it, we pack it, we ship it - why? - so you can proudly enjoy it!</p>
					<p>We require a Manufacturer's Affidavit of Origin on all yarns that we purchase, ensuring adherence to the highest quality yarns. We strongly believe that sourcing the best raw materials available to us results in the best performing products. Life is sometimes as simple as the choices you make.</p>
					<p>We work directly with all our suppliers even for the smallest components such as trims, labels and threads that make up the product. We believe that sub contracting even these smaller items can and will compromise quality. We look closer and go deeper to deliver the very best to you.</p>
