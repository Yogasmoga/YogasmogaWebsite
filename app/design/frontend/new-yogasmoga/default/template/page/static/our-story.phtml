                    <p>We take the stand that physically, mentally, and emotionally Karma works in harmony with innovation, so that technology becomes a pathway to greater good. In the act of balancing science with spirituality you cause a chemical reaction that can promote something as great as change. Connecting, interacting and creating a positive impact beyond the Yoga mat.</p>
                    <p>We engineer, design, and manufacture fabrics that do more than cover someone up. They open them up to greater good. While we work with the most technically advanced fabric and manufacturing technologies, we also pursue a relentless focus on the deep traditions of Yoga. We embody the soul of Yoga and instinctively embed this into everything we create, including investing much time into creating the <a href="/namaskar" class="f11">NAMASK&Aacute;R foundation</a>.</p>
