					<p>Many consumers don’t realize that every piece of clothing that is made any where in the world is stitched together by a human: Every piece of clothing generally goes through the same labor-intensive stitching process. Labor at times accounts for 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing.</p>
<p>We chose to manufacture our products in factories in the US. Many domestic factories have been left behind in the quest by brands to chase the cheapest labor abroad. We take pride in giving the opportunity to domestic workers who are qualified technicians with a lot of experience but not enough work so we deliver the highest quality product to our customers. </p>

					<p>We feel a sense of achievement that we are doing our part to stimulate the domestic economy - hiring individuals at our headquarters in New York City, at our stores and in all of our various factories. Workers that are manufacturing  YOGASMOGA apparel domestically have health insurance and 401(k) plans.</p>
