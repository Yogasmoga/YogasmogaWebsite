                    <div>
                        <p>We collect two types of information from visitors of our website: personally identifiable
                            information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>

                        <p>If you purchase our products or services, we request certain personally identifiable
                            information from you on our order form. This includes contact information such as your name,
                            email address, and shipping address, as well as financial information such as a credit card
                            number and its expiration date. We use the personally identifiable information that we
                            collect for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an
                            order, we also will use this information to contact you.</p>

                        <p>In addition, if you contact us by email through our website, we may keep a record of your
                            contact information and correspondence. In any event, we reserve the right to use your email
                            address and any other personally identifiable information that you provide to us to respond
                            to you and to send you marketing materials for our own products and services. We will not
                            share your information with outside parties who wish to market other products and services
                            to you.</p>

                        <p>If at any time you would like to change your personally identifiable information, or if you
                            no longer wish to receive materials from us or would like your personal information removed
                            from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@yogasmoga.com"

                            Alternatively, if you receive materials from us by email you can make use of the "opt out"
                            provision in our communications so that we know that you no longer wish to receive any
                            materials from us.</p>

                        <p>Like most websites, our website may incorporate “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, or similar

                            website. Pixel tags and cookies are used to collect non-personally identifiable information,
