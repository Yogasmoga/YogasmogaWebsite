    <p>RANGOLI is a community space that YOGASMOGA has created<br/>
        to engage those who are interested in living healthy, yoga-filled,<br/>

    <p>We recognize the important role color has in shaping our world.<br/>
        We know when to "stop" and "go" based on interchanging red and green lights,<br/>
        we describe sadness by feeling blue, we find the silver lining in things; in short,<br/>
        color gives meaning and dimension to our world; we have a relationship with<br/>
        color and use color to express who we are and what we connect with. </p>

    <p>When you sign up for RANGOLI, you get a RANGOLI in your favorite color.<br/>
        As spend and share, your RANGOLI charm becomes more complex and colorful.</p>
